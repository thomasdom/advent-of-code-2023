# Advent of Code 2023 challenge code solutions

This is my personal attempt of solving AoC 2023's daily code challenges.

All code solutions are written in Javascript, and run by Node.js.

## Requirements

Node.js (latest LTS)

## Installation

- Install Node.js (or use `nvm`)
- Clone this repository
- cd `advent-of-code-2023` (Or your custom folder name)
- `npm install`

## Run a solution

`npm run <day>`

`<day>` corresponds to the challenge day, hardcoded in `package.json`'s scripts.

Example: `npm run day01`
